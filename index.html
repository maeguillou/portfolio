    <h3>Personal & Professional Profile</h3>
    <p>
        I am a final-year general engineering student specializing in continuous improvement and Lean management.
        My academic and professional journey has allowed me to develop a strong interest in industrial performance,
        structured problem-solving, and operational excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before entering engineering studies, I spent two years training in a high-level tennis academy.
        Although this experience was outside the academic framework, it required discipline, rigor, consistency,
        and a permanent search for improvement. These values strongly shaped my mindset and are directly aligned
        with the principles of continuous improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, I apply this performance-oriented mindset to engineering projects and industrial environments,
        with the objective of creating sustainable and measurable improvements.

    <h3>Academic Background</h3>
    <p>
        After completing a scientific preparatory class (MPSI–MP), I joined ECAM Strasbourg-Europe,
        where I am currently completing a Master’s degree in General Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        This multidisciplinary curriculum provided me with a strong technical foundation in engineering sciences,
        combined with project management, data analysis, and industrial methodologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        My specialization in continuous improvement allowed me to deepen my knowledge of Lean management,
        KPI monitoring, process optimization, and operational performance.

    <h3>Main Professional Experience</h3>

    <h4>Methods Engineer Intern – Soluscope (Ecolab)</h4>
    <p>
        During my internship, I worked on Lean and TPM projects focused on PPE management and the implementation
        of a tube cutting station.
    </p>
    <p>
        I developed Excel tracking tools and visual management standards using Lean methodologies
        such as 5S, Kanban, and PDCA, in close collaboration with production, logistics, and HSE teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        These actions contributed to improved safety, better traceability, and increased productivity.

<section id="projects">
    <h3>Engineering Mindset & Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>
        Through my academic projects and professional experiences, I learned that continuous improvement
        is not only based on tools, but also on people, communication, and change management.
    </p>
    <p>
        My background in competitive sport helped me develop resilience, focus, and a structured approach
        to challenges, which I now apply in engineering contexts.
    </p>

<section id="vision">
    <h3>Professional Vision</h3>
    <p>
        My objective is to start my career as an engineer specialized in continuous improvement,
        Lean management, or industrial performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        I aim to contribute to organizations by structuring processes, improving safety and productivity,
        and supporting teams in achieving sustainable performance.
